Future Improvements (Potential Enhancements)

API Integration: Integrate with external movie databases (e.g., The Movie Database API - TMDB) to automatically fetch movie details (description, release year, genre, poster image) based on the title input.

User Interface Refinements: Implement JavaScript/AJAX for asynchronous operations (e.g., quick status updates or live search) to prevent full page reloads and improve responsiveness.

Search and Filtering: Add robust search functionality and advanced filtering options (e.g., filter by Status, Genre, or User Rating).

User Profiles: Develop comprehensive user profile pages where users can view statistics about their watched movies and average ratings.
